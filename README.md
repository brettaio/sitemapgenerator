Open generateList.js and edit the '/routes' that you require in your sitemap.

Install node_modules with "npm i"

Once generate list is edited, also add your URL domain, https://example.com, run "npm run full" to product an XML.

Check package.json for individual components to generate the list and sitemap.

All the best,

Bretta
